deep-microservices-root-vanilla
===============================

[Repository_Badges_Placeholder]

deep-microservices-root-vanilla is the fundamental building block used by cloud-native web applications
built on top of [DEEP Framework](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework) and
[Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com). This microservice provides the root structure of the web application 
that is developed in vanilla / plain JavaScript, without using any framework like AngularJS or ReactJS.


## Getting Started

### Step 1. Pre-requisites

- [x] [Create an Amazon Web Services account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WviHsoz8yHk)
- [x] [Configure AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
- [x] [Get Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [x] [Install nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) and [use latest node v4](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage)
- [ ] Install DEEP CLI, also known as `deepify`:

```bash
npm install deepify -g
```

> If you want to use `deepify` on Windows, please follow the steps from
[Windows Configuration](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework/blob/master/docs/windows.md)
before running `npm install deepify -g` and make sure all `npm` and `deepify` commands are executed
inside Git Bash.

### Step 2. Install Microservice(s) Locally

```bash
deepify install github://MitocGroup/deep-microservices-helloworld ~/deep-microservices-helloworld
```

> If you execute `mkdir ~/deep-microservices-helloworld && cd ~/deep-microservices-helloworld`
before `deepify install ...`, in this case path parameter is optional and can be skipped (e.g. 
`~/deep-microservices-helloworld`). It will assume current folder in all `deepify` commands.

### Step 3. Run Microservice(s) in Development

```bash
deepify server ~/deep-microservices-helloworld -o
```

> When this step is finished, you can open in your browser the link *http://localhost:8000*
and enjoy the deep-microservices-helloworld running locally.

### Step 4. Run Microservice(s) in Production

```bash
deepify deploy ~/deep-microservices-helloworld
```

> Amazon CloudFront distribution takes up to 20 minutes to provision, therefore donâ€™t worry
if it returns an HTTP error in the first couple of minutes.
